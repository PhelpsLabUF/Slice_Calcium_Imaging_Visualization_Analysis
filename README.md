# Slice_Calcium_Imaging_Visualization_Analysis
This code is used to analyze data collected from dynamic calcium recordings on human pancreas tissue slices. The code first collects and organizes large datasets from the recordings, normalizes the slices, then analyzes the peak calcium responses across non diabetic, auto-antibody, and type 1 diabetes donors.
