# Slice_Calcium_Imaging_Visualization_Analysis
This code is used to analyze data collected from dynamic calcium recordings on human pancreas tissue slices. 
# Ca Imaging Analysis 
The code first collects and organizes large datasets from the recordings, normalizes the slices, then analyzes the peak calcium responses across non diabetic, auto-antibody, and type 1 diabetes donors. 
# Fixed Imaging Analysis 
This code analyzes large datasets from fixed stainings for mitochondrial and citric acid cycle markers.
